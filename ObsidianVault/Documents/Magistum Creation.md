The Magistum began as a conglomerate of universities and companies. Members disliked the control of that the [[Old Testament Luminary Church]] had over scientific inquiry. Specifically, they wanted to research taboo ancient languages and artifacts obtained from the [[Hollowspire Roots]].
Their goal was to understand how it worked, and to reverse engineer them.
This group of incredibly intelligent scientists and engineers pioneered the scientific revolution; creating the most important invention; a magic language. Which allowed almost anyone to cast a spell, given that the correct runic program was engineered. 

Using this they were able to start producing lucrative technology, and begin massively improve production. The lucky dukedoms and baronies that invested in them early saw their GDP skyrocket. 
Some of the first technologies developed were
- [[Crossfire Rifles]]
- Drills
- Chainsaws
- Mechanical Presses

This made the Magistum incredibly wealthy, and very powerful since they controlled the distribution of the standard runic language. 
Soon, the Luminary church was starting to lose their favor as the Magistum grew in influence and a scientific and religious revolution swept through the west. This was the new testament, a position on magic that was not centralized to being controlled by the church.
