Being able to heal from any injury is freeing, but it also presents some writing challenges. For instance how can we ever have a character who is wearing an eyepatch if we can just heal it in lore? What about bionic limbs? If you can heal anything, it creates plot holes.

So you can't heal **everything**.
Wounds that cannot be healed even with magic are called *parascars*
If you are mortally wounded by a parascar, you cannot be revived.

# Fire
Burns do not heal with magic. Fire doesn't just destroy what it burns, it destroys the phantom of what it burns.

This means if you are burned badly, you cannot heal it fully even with the best magic. Period. An exception is made for explosions, your limbs can be blown off by a shockwave, but as long as you didn't burn you can still heal.

Fire is thus seen as extremely terrifying. It represents true destruction. Arsons and pyromancers are given special treatment.

But this means fire is also a powerful weapon against phantoms. Burning down a cursed building actually does cleanse it. Casting a cursed artifact into a fire really does destroy the phantom causing the effect. Killing someone with fire, will prevent them from becoming a demon. 

# Phantoms
Some paranormal attacks from the [[Phant]] can cause parascars. For instance [[Unnamed Weapon Type]]s are intended to attack phantoms, and can interfere with healing.


# Eyesight
Eyesight is fickle when it comes to healing. I don't have anything concrete for this. Other than the Phant can contain enigmatic cognito-hazards.
