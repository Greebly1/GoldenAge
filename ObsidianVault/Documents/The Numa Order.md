The Numa are an organization within the Magistum that specializes in traditional magic and most notably in interpreting the [[Phant]]. 
Numa agents are trained, sometimes from birth, sometimes recruited from someone who possesses proficiency for the Phant.
They are trained to perceive and interpret the Phant, in hopes to gain [[Phantom Eyes]]. 
![[Numa Training]]

A Numa's clairvoyance is not perfect. These are 'hunches' and 'gut feelings' often. Numa agents have to practice removing their own hallucinations from the Phant. As a result they are often very unsure of things, and you can actually trick them if you are good enough at suppressing your curse. But they will still have a gut feeling, the question is if they trust it enough, how sure are they that you are half-demon? Expect them to keep an eye on you though.
Numa are still very impressive though, able to determine things that shouldn't be possible to know.
