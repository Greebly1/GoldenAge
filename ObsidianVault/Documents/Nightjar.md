# Intro
There are chill winds in the night, refreshing. Where no eyes stare, freeing. 
The walls of the [[Samrita Claret]] are cold, and the building is asleep. At the peak of its tower you can glimpse her.
A celestial, cold and all-seeing floats listlessly above the slumbering city, speckled by the twinkling hopes of dreamers. Its light falls on the nightmares that haunt. Its cold is a hot iron.
It is this light she drinks. This refreshing wind, this quite, this peace, this beauty.
Moonlight rests on her still form, a monster. The cool air rushing past rows of sharp teeth to fill her lungs. A maw that doesn't eat. Many eyes that never blink. Fur, feathers, scales that never feel. Stiff, gangly wings outstretched. The tail, the talons, everything freed from the shadows that bind, now strewn about the floor.
All of her eyes, massive and unblinking, stare at the moon.
The Nightjar.

# Appearance
Standing at about 6"2'
She hides her face under gray wraps and a large gaiter.
	She wears a cylindrical priest hat (Moodboard --> Boogiepop) adorned with feathers and ornaments. 
Her hair is black, and braided into many thin strands about shoulder length. The braids are also adorned with metal and feathers and terminate in silver ornaments. Her braids peek our from under the hat, and fall over the gaiter.
	So all in all, you can only see a thin slit of her face, her eyes. She has at least 5 of them. Whatever her face looks like under the cloth, it is truly monstrous. Where her right eye socket would be, is two diagonal eyes fighting for dominance. Her left eye socket is almost equally malformed between 3 smaller eyes. Her pupils are a magenta blue, and they never move, they never blink. She turns her whole head to look at things, craning her neck like an owl. Sometimes, the whites of her eyes become a black, with gray details.
A tattered black cloak drapes over her body, hiding her limbs. Thankfully, her body is still humanoid. Inside her cloak, somewhat comedically is about a hundred vials of eye drops. Every 30 seconds she applies them to her eyes.
	This cloak, and her hat, hair, and gaiter are the defining aspects of her silhouette. Dominantly she has a rectangular silhouette, although depending on her pose it is very flowy. (Moodboard --> Ozen, Guts)
She wears what looks like some sort of gray puffy compression suit reminiscent of a pilot suit. Parts of it are sewn, repaired patchwork. Rips and tears in the fabric, like designer jeans, reveal dark fur trying to escape its prison.
	The suit is tucked into a pair of fat boots, bulky (moodboard --> Ozen)
She wears fingerless gloves, also adorned with beads and silver metal. Instead of fingers, sharp talons poke through the fingerholes.
	Nightjar also has tits, they are not impressive though but they do lend to the physical sculpt of her grotesque yet feminine form.
Underneath her clothes, her skin is scaly, and furry, (moodboard --> Tobi-Kadachi). Some areas even have feathers. It is clear she is an amalgamation of several beastly curses.

# Personality
Nightjar is a rather introverted demon. She is extremely cautious. 
She is the type who stays near the outskirts of a group meeting.
Since Nightjar is a member of the [[Snake Eyes]], she is also a disciple of [[Denki]], the deity of envy. As a result NJ is a rather jealous person, although she hides it very very well. 

But despite being so scary looking, NJ is a very kind person. Any time NJ appears it is to help.

NJ is soft spoken, and never interrupts people. It is actually impossible for her to do so.

**Alignment** - Chaotic Good
	NJ is actually a very good demon despite being so grotesque. She does not prey on humans, only other demons. NJ has helped a lot of people, and continues to do so. Whether it be advice, information, money, or more, NJ can't stop from helping others.
Unfortunately, it is hard to help humans, when you look like that. Scary.

**Sexuality** - N/A
	Due to, several curses, NJ cannot have intercourse. She is a virgin and will unfortunately die that way. This is one of the things she is often envious of normal people. However, this does not stop her from having purely romantic relationships.

**Goals** - Collect all curses
	Nightjar's goal is to collect and destroy all the curses from the world. If she can be the sponge that soaks up the evil. It gives her a strange pleasure to gain a curse.
	As her goal is to help the world, NJ is deeply entrenched in the philosophical thoughts on what curses are, and the nature of them. A curse can be so much more than some magic spell. A way of thinking, a memory, a feeling, a socioeconomic position, etc.
	In a sense, NJ embodies the true spirit of a demon-slayer, however she herself is a demon.


# Ability - Perfect Black
This ability gives nightjar the power to one-way transfer certain curses to herself. 

Furthermore, Perfect Black can soak up corruption like a sponge.
	When she does this interestingly, it just makes places feel better.  graveyard she has visited will just not be scary.
	She rarely uses this though, since she cannot hold onto an infinite amount of corruption. Instead she uses it as a way to move corruption from place to place. 

Perfect black is actually a pneuma ability. This means she can actually 'see' spiritual corruption and poison. NJ actually has a curse sense.

# [[Cognivore]]
Nightjar hides her face for a good reason. Somewhere along the way of becoming a monster she developed into a cognitive hazard, specifically a cognivore.

Those who see her face, and stare into her eyes have a 'reflection' of nightjar imprinted into their psyche. The reflection is like a snapshot or clone of her consciousness in that moment. It leeches on people's minds. She doesn't even control it since they are clones of her.
	She can however, reclaim her reflection from people, in turn gaining whatever info the reflection gleamed. Kind of like a merge conf

While this is extremely useful, (for her being a tutorial agent), it can be an OPsec hazard. Since her enemies can extract information from this reflection. Also she has good reason to not trust her cognivore reflections, a more sophisticated cognivore could likely unify them to work together, but she is a disciple of the god of envy. 

# Shadow Magic
Nightjar practices a unique form of illusionary shadow magic. She can bend, manipulate, create, and hide in shadows. She can hide a number of things within a shadow meaning, her cloak is sort of a storehouse. 

She can hide in shadows, jump from shadow to shadow.

# Relationships
**Magistum**
Nightjar is a high value target hunted by the Magistum. The secret police have deemed her to be a demonic threat that must be quarantined.
	This is also because, since she is unlucky, despite doing more good than bad, she is blamed for certain things simply for coinciding with bad stuff. Similar to Vash the Stampede.
A specialized task force pursues Nightjar

**[[Millions Eyes]]**
Nightjar is a close acquaintance of Millions. Interestingly, one of the few people Millions would help without requiring a deal to be met.
"I do not want your eyes, they are awful, they can't even blink. No, our trades will be limited to information only."

**Phoenix Warmages**
NJ is an ally of the phoenix warmages benala chapter. She often gives [[Cade Weber]] advice and information. Sort of like a private investigator. 

**The Legion**
NJ, is an enemy of the legion, however, they do not know this. The legion thinks she is an ally, since they both are enemies of the Magistum.

# [[Nightjar's Hideout]]
When she isn't investigating or scouring the city of [[Benala]], Nightjar is at her hideout, her nest. 

#TODO where is it actually located? how to get to it?

## Mementos
Mementos to the curses she has broken are scattered about her hideout.

There is a small canvas painting of her monstrous form, from a time when she was less grotesque. For a long time this was how she knew what she looked like. She has no reflection in a mirror. The artist that painted it was one of the people she helped.

A more recent children's drawing of her. The backstory of which is revealed in the side story, [[A Contemplation on Curses]]

# Philosophical Views on Curses
While she possesses the ability to take away magical curses of others, and the ability to see negativity, Nightjar has developed a unique philosophy on curses.
Her philosophy is explored a bit in the aforementioned short story. 

Her ideas align with the study of Ontology https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology. 

A curse is anything that haunts someone. It can be a memory, a dependency, an ambition, loneliness, a relationship, the future. 
All people are but a reflection of the world they have experienced, and what you see as the world is but a reflection of your own judgements projecting onto that world.
Think about what curses you suffer. Loneliness? Financial insecurity? Anxiety? Think about a bad memory that haunts you.
Who would we be without these curses? What would we act like? How would we feel? What would we want? In all cases, whoever that person would be, is a different person than who we are.

To change, means to commit violence upon yourself. Like a dying tree, dead branches need to be attended to, new branches must be grown, roots must spread.
To Nightjar, life is but an endless cycle of constant death and rebirth. With every observation we make, with every action we make.

The existence of curses serve to increase happiness by virtue of contrast. Rather, the memory of suffering serves to give meaning to happiness. 

Nightjar notes how, those who have more curses, freed and broken, exhibit more strength and happiness than those who have never been cursed to begin with. 

Furthermore, Nightjar notes how society as a whole operates like a single conscious. If you understand how stock prices are calculated, this is similar. Curses and negativity as a whole spread through society like a wave. One negative development causes a wave that travels through friends, coworkers, and acquaintances, attenuating through a game of telephone. Curses, beget more curses.

Despite all of this, Nightjar believes that all curses can be broken. And that the future can be saved by breaking all of the curses. People who would otherwise discard their humanity and become monsters, can instead become strong and kind. In a sense, Nightjar is a true demon slayer
