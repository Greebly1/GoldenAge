Mood board --> [[MillionsEyes.pur]]

Name inspiration comes from Millions Knives from Trigun.
AKA
	The God of strategy
	The God of information
	The God of eyes
	Max
# Appearance
Millions is rarely *seen*. It is logistically impossible to fully see him, because of the shape, form and size of his body.
	The most we get, is hundreds of eyes in the darkness moving independent of each other and blinking in a wave pattern.

Oftentimes he appears in a shadow in the crook of a tree, or of a cave, or doorway or window, etc. Just like you do with Hunter from Hollow Knight (see mood board)

His actual body however, is the most grotesque thing. Even more grotesque than [[Nightjar]]'s body. 
His body is more of an *infrastructure* for his eyes. It is built-into his domain and it grows and spreads like roots. He is a flesh, tentacle monster that has spec'd all of his resources to eyes. Somewhere in his domain is his central neural vault that contains his brain, and from here thousands of biological cables spread out through his domain to connect his millions of eyes to his brain through neurons.
Overall he looks similar to Siva (see mood board)

A number of *drones* are connected to his neural roots, these are like proxies for him to speak to people through. These drones are silhouettes of grotesque insectoid abominations adorned with hundreds of eyes.

At any given moment Millions Eyes is in many many different places at the same time, seeing so many things.

# Personality
Millions is the God of information and strategy. His goal is always to gleam as much information as possible from everything in the world.
His belief is that this world contains finite factual information, and that attaining all the information will allow you to ascend to a higher state of existence

Every little thing you do, or don't do, every action and every reaction; every subtlety and minor movement is watched from hundreds of angles and analyzed.
If you don't want to give away your secrets accidentally, you must have a godlike poker face.

He loves games though, specifically games that are so complex that he cannot learn all of the right moves. Somewhat humorously, he calls himself the greatest gamer in the world.
he also loves thought experiments and game theory.
## Goal
Millions' goal is to collect information.

# [[Occulith]]
The name of his domain he has built, is called Occulith.
TLDR
	It is a vast pocket dimension connecting to many many different planes. It is a dark cave system with his neural cables spreading far out.

# Logistical Immortality
Millions has made is so difficult to kill him, it is a statistical impossibility for him to be killed.
You would need to traverse his unmapped domain, which he controls, and destroy each and every one of his eyes and neural vaults.
	Still this hasn't stopped the Magistum from trying.

# Merchant
Millions also collects artifacts and rare items. 

But the main thing he collects are **eyes**
	and information

Millions loves to make deals with people, he loves haggling. 
Deal such as
- One of your eyes for secret information
- Tell me something and I will tell you something
- Run a small errand in exchange for advice
- Become one of my eyes for forbidden knowledge
- Give me an eye in exchange for safe passage through my domain
- I will give you a special eye, that can see things others can't if you kill someone for me
- I will trade your blind eyes for the eyes of an eagle for a price
- I will relay a message to someone faster than any horseman, carrier pidgin or mailman can deliver, for a price.
- Beat me in a game of chess and I will give you forbidden knowledge


# Become an Eye
Becoming one of Million's Eyes means you go about your life regularly, however he sees everything you see.

This is a massive security concern for the Magistum. As such they do not allow officials of any rank to make such deals with Millions. (of course the lure of forbidden knowledge and bribery from Millions is still attractive to many)

# As the internet
Millions is an analogy for the internet. It is something that you can give information to, (it will gleam info from you whether you want it or not) and that information is now accessible by anyone.
	Classified government secret leaked to Millions? Well now rival countries know who your spies are.


# Relationships
## [[Nightjar]]
Millions is close with nightjar. She is one of the few people Millions may help for free.
He is a believer in Nightjar's quest and philosophy. Furthermore the two of them work together to do private investigation work, even though Millions pulls the most weight being the God of information.

## Magistum
The Magistum is keenly aware of Millions and have adopted a specialized operational process for dealing with him as well as security rules pertaining to his existence.
see --> [[Magistum OPSEC]]

## [[Cade Weber]]
Millions and Cade are game buddies. They play all sorts of strategy table-top board games.
- War games
- Card games
- Chess and others
Cade is able to basically get free training in strategic thinking this way.
Furthermore, Cade specifically made a special deal with Millions, to trade his cross-breed eyes for regular unassuming human eyes. (this was actually a downgrade and Millions still owes him for it technically)

# [[Thousands Eyes]]
During [[Secula 3]] a raid on his domain leads to mass destruction of most of his eyes and neural vaults.

Thousands is kind of like a different character, having forgotten a lot of his memories due to the destruction of his neurons.
