The archmage serves for 10 years, and is not elected. Archmages are chosen by the previous archmage.
They have the ability to block any regulations being passed. Furthermore they control the paladin order.

The office of Archmage was proposed as a measure to ensure will of the founders of the Magistum is carried unto eternity.
	That is, the will of [[Archmage Eternal]], oh but that's surely just a conspiracy theory.
