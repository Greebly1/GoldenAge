Guilds are very decentralized organiztions within the [[Magistum Treasury]] ]that deal with grants and subsidies for specific industries. For instance the Demonslayer Guild (which by this point is still part of the Magistum but pretty damn decentralized) provides companies and individuals registered to them with subsidies and services outlined in the legislation. 
Often these guilds are economic centers. For instance the Warmage's Guild holds an annual wartech conference, where private militaries go to network with weapons development companies.
There are a lot of guilds, I'm not going to write them all down, this is some versatile worldbuilding stuff to create as we need. Remember, these are industries that the 3 houses want to develop. But to list a few ideas...
- Demonslayer Guild
- Warmage Guild
- Construction Guild
- Research Guild
- Spellsmith Guild
- Educator's Guild
- Etc
