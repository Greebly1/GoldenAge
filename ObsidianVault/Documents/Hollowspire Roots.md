A dark labyrinthian substructure that was allegedly built by the ancient [[Latrican]]s during [[Latrican Ascent]].

Entrances to the Hollowspire are scattered across #TODO (name of European continent) in caves.
Some of these entrances are guarded and revered as holy sites. 
	Some entrances are even found in other planes and pocket dimensions

The name *Hollowspire Roots* conveys the idea of a hollow (a cave), spire (a structure built from the bottom up, used to ascend). 
Roots illustrates that it is a massive interconnected labyrinth that all originates from a central point.
# Expeditions
Numerous expeditions are always underway to attempt to map and understand the Hollowspire. Most routes terminate in dead ends or cave system collapses, but occasionally they connect to other Rootspire entrances or substratum ecosystems and pocket dimensions.

These expeditions find rare minerals, forgotten magical artifacts with effects impossible to reverse engineer, ancient texts and paintings, masonic wall tapestries depicting prophecies, and of course, monsters.

# Layers / Biomes / Points of Interest
#TODO 
The Hollowspire is a massive self contained ecosystem. Much like the dungeon in Dungeon Messhi

# Brainstorm
- A character may get lost in the Hollowspire (maybe they wanted to get lost)
- An army or platoon may be forced to retreat into an unknown entrance to the Hollowspire, and be pursued by the ones they are trying to escape from.
- An expedition may temporarily halt, or return with excavation equipment while they attempt to clear a cave system collapse
- The substratum of a massive city may connect to the Hollowspire
- A cave may collapse trapping a group (potentially separating people), in the Hollowspire.
- The criminal underworld, or a malicious bad actor may use the Hollowspire for smuggling, or as their HQ
- A massive doorway to the underworld remains locked
