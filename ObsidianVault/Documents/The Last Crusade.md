The last crusade was a period of intense political tension followed by widespread bloodshed and conflict between the [[Old Testament Luminary Church]] and the early [[Magistum]]

# Why the war began
During the [[Magistum Creation]] and its rise to influence, it often found itself butting heads with the [[Old Testament Luminary Church]].
Overall it was a fight to determine who had the authority to regulate magnus. 

The church believed magnus was divine magic, and that it was the church's duty to control and administer it.

The Magistum, while many of its members were religious, did not believe magnus was magic, as they researched it they understand it better, to them it was science. They did not believe it should be controlled by the church. Following archaic rules would hinder civilization's development.
Furthermore, (and what truly gained the enmity of the old testament church), several countries that aligned with the Magistum for their goods and services started their own churches as a way to gain independence from the church similar to the origins of the Anglican Church. TODO, make a name for this [[New Testament Church]]. 
The Magistum was deeply aligned and tied to this new testament church. The kingdom that initially changed to this new testament church and propped it up became the Magistum's main sponsor. TODO, flesh out whatever country sponsored this new church and welcomed the Magistum. This way a the Magistum gained protection from both other countries and the New Testament Church.
Most countries tried to play the middle-ground. Attempting to appease both the high council of the church, and the Magistum government. However this was very difficult due to conflicting regulations involving magnus. Countries that tried to play both sides would find themselves at risk of losing both their favor from the church and their membership in the Magistum.

# Escalation
The Church would excommunicate nobles who aligned with the Magistum, such as barons who sought to use magitek to improve their farms or even noblewomen who purchased textiles manufactured using magitek.
This tension skyrocketed in this period. Nobody wanted to take a side out of fear of angering the church or cutting ties with the Magistum and their lucrative business opportunities. 
It started with unsanctioned searches and seizures of [[Magistum]] property by the church. And escalated to skirmishes when the Magistum hired mercenaries. One day the leaders of the old testament church declared a crusade against the heretical Magistum. Historians unanimously agree that this was a mistake.
Immediately the Magistum held a special council of all three houses. Each member nation was forced either break all ties with the church or be ex communicated from the council and all benefits afforded to them.
Those that sided with the Magistum developed joint military war plans and emergency decrees. In this time a charter was produced to create the first Magistum joint military countil, the [[Special Warmages Council]] that served all member nations made up of chosen soldiers from member nations. Generals from each nation's military gathered as leaders in this council to share resources, intel, and war plans. 
Legislators put aside a large budget for the special warmages council, used in the procurement of advanced weaponry and training of special international brigades.  
Perhaps though the most important legislation created, was the [[Need a name Decree]]

# The War
TODO, flesh this out more
It was the bloodiest war seen thus far in the continent.  Although the Magistum was mostly fighting defensive campaigns, the Magistum were not opposed to member nations leading offensive campaigns of their own to gain more land and resources.
The Magistum's advantages were
- Member nations were more coordinated
- Superior weapons
- Advanced logistics
The Church had
- more member nations
- more soldiers, outnumbering the Magistum 5-1
- more money
While the crusade succeeded in taking some key swathes of land, every foot of land came with heavy expense to the church, and little to the Magistum.
Despite the direction of the war the Church was not conceding, they had a near endless supply of faithful followers eager to earn their right to paradise. 
	However, as time went a few nations saw infighting. As revolutionaries who saw [[The Visiones Aurum]]
### Assassination
One fateful day an assassination attempt was made on the Magistum's Archmage and figurehead [[Alexander Felgrand]] at the time. A suicide bomber got into close contact with him, he survived, losing his vision, killing his son, and injuring his wife; she made a full recovery.
From that day Alexander adopted a policy of total warfare. He personally joined the war as a general in the warmages special council. In his campaign against the Old Testament Church he completely destroyed Constadt, the capital of the old testament church. Where a massive city stood, is now uninhabitable ruins.
While it is classified how exactly they called down a meteor on Constadt, it is widely believed that an advanced telekinetic weapon was developed that was capable of altering the trajectory of celestial objects.

3 Things happened thereafter
- The Magistum became the main authority on magic in the west
- Constadt was quarantined as the first demonic exclusion zone
- Restrictions were placed on advanced long range telekinesis, it was illegal to sponsor independent research into it.
- Alexander the Kingdom Breaker stepped down during an impeachment hearing for developing the secret weapons program and sentenced to restrictions on his powers
Internal investigations into Alexander were performed. Likely the results of these investigations were why he stepped down.
