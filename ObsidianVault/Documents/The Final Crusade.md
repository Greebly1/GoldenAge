It started with unsanctioned searches and seizures of Magistum property by the church. And escalated to skirmishes when the Magistum hired mercenaries. One day the leaders of the old testament church declared a crusade against the heretical Magistum. Historians unanimously agree that this was a mistake. It was the bloodiest war seen thus far in the continent. And due to superior technology the Magistum was winning. 
Despite the direction of the war the Church was not conceding, they had a near endless supply of faithful followers eager to earn their right to paradise. One fateful day an assassination attempt was made on the Magistum's Archmage [[Alexander Felgrand]] at the time. A suicide bomber got into close contact with him, he survived, losing his vision, killing his daughter, and injuring his wife.
From that day Alexander adopted a policy of total warfare. In his campaign against the Old Testament Church he completely destroyed Constadt, the capital of the old testament church. Where a massive city stood, is now uninhabitable ruins.
