Visions of Gold
During the [[Magistum Creation]] was a time when those destitute in humanity's future saw a ray of hope. 
This idea of the golden vision was a vision of a new world, of a golden age. Even the most devout pessimist would shift into childlike naivety thinking of what the future could hold. 
Bountiful harvests and crystal clear water, cooking machines, lively night cities, robot assistants and flying machines. 

The actual Visiones Aurum was a pamphlet written and distributed among early intellectual networks in the Magistum. While the author _is unknown_ ~~[[Archmage Eternal]]~~, it gained immense popularity and is heralded as a key part of the Magistum's culture. 
The pamphlet is a collection of promising technologies and entrepreneurial ideas, alongside illustrations painting someone's vision of a fantastical new world.
