Also known as the Magistum secret police. The paladins take orders from the Archmage. Paladins are experienced demonslayers who have developed [[Phantom Eyes]], they work closely with [[The Numa Order]]. Their goals involve global stability, often dealing with the Phant, and the godlike dieties that reside in it.
Like an SCP foundation, the Paladins quarantine anomalous 'cursed' entities and monsters. If they suspect you have a curse, they will arrest you, research you, and either; release you, kill you, or recruit you. 
In a world of warm chaos they represent cold order.
