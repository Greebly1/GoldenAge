The territory that the Magistum takes up, as the sum of all member countries, is divided into governing provinces of near-equal populations (often transcending international borders). Each province democratically elects one senator. Each senator represents roughly, 1 million people. Every two years the provinces are remapped to follow population changes. Thus, as the total population of the west increases, the number of senators increases. Excess is always rounded down. At the beginning of secula 2, there are 80 senators.

The senate receives legislation from the delegation and will vote on it two times
- One is to determine if that senator approves the legislation
- One is to determine if that senator thinks the legislation involves the Magistum

If a bill is determined to involve the Magistum, such as creating subsidies for an international railway system, that bill is then sent to the Archmage for revision and approval. Otherwise, if it doesn't involve the Magistum and the senate agrees on it, it is not sent to the Archmage.
For instance, an open-borders agreement between member countries is not deemed to involve the Magistum. Although, that opinion will differ depending on which senator you ask.
