### Special Notes
I believe over-centralization can be a common world-building trap. For instance, each faction in 40k is so centralized that it often overshadows the potential for individual planets. This may be intended, but it has more to do with developing new content rather than existing content.
It always starts with this idea of 'the empire,' any time we make content it goes along the lines of "They control the strongest army... they train everyone in everything, they manage all the schools... they have all of the resources... they have a special branch for this and that..."
At first nothing seems bad about such a worldbuilding project, but it becomes limiting if you are stuck in that mindset. Unless you add some degree of decentralization, all conflict must come from another external entity (in the grand scheme of things). 
What if instead, your giant mega empire doesn't actually control the strongest military, what if they just pay private military companies. Well now we've just opened up more possibilities in our writing. This is what versatile world building is about. 

So I really want the Magistum to be less centralized, less pervasive in the story. Yes they matter, yes they are the most powerful organization, but they often have little to do with day-to-day life. They don't have control over the economy, but they are very important to it.

# What is it?
The Magistum is the authority on magic in the west. Countries seek membership in the Magistum for access to services, however mainly, for being able to use their [[Runic Programming Languages]]. 
Furthermore the Magistum controls over 80% of the energy industry in the west. From extraction to enrichment and refinement. 
As you read and understand the political structure of the Magistum, know that magnus production is almost always determined by the Senate to be involving the Magistum. It is favorable to competing countries to force their competitors to legislate their magnus resources to the Magistum. Come back here after reading about the political structure of the Magistum.

### Ministry of Energy
TODO 
Subject to change
TLDR
	Entity within the magistum responsible for extracting, refining, and enriching magnus energy. These resources are given to the treasury to use. 
	The leader of the ministry of energy and the leader of the treasury both answer to the Archmage. Any changes the three of them want to make regarding their budgets must be put through legislation.
