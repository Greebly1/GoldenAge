Eternal is an enigmatic chronomancer that subtly manipulates the world from the shadows. Who began as an immortal mage with [[Omniscient Eyes]], has now become a [[Phantom Deity]]. He is inspired by Odin.

His goal?
He wants to see humanity survive forever. He does not want to be alone for eternity.
As a chronomancer he has witnessed mankind destroy itself millions of times. Through careful actions he wants to see humanity develop advanced technology and not destroy themself. Mankind must build their paradise, and survive to enjoy it.

He cannot directly intervene since he is a deity. His intervention causes an equal reaction within the Phant. When he tries changing the world directly with his own hands it erupts into chaos from other [[Phantom Deity]]s. His actions give them more power.
The best example is [[The Visiones Aurum]], which was written by Archmage Eternal and had profound impact on the culture of the Magistum and the world. But since he was the one who wrote it, other Phantom Deities were able to twist it into the [[Mania Aurum]]

Like any phantom deity, he can still affect the world, indirectly. The more indirectly he can do it, the higher advantage he has over the other Phantom Deities. 
The two most notable ways 
1. Through his manipulations the [[Magistum Creation]] started
2. Each and every Archmage communes with Eternal
3. Through writings and pamphlets under the pen-name TODO make a pen name for archmage eternal.
		Despite the Visiones Aurum being twisted into the Mania Aurum, given the amount of impact it made versus the amount of damage done, it was a win for Eternal over the rest of the Phant.
