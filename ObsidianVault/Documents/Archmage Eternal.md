Eternal is an enigmatic chronomancer that subtly manipulates the world from the shadows. Who began as an immortal mage with [[Omniscient Eyes]], has now become a [[Phantom Deity]]. He is inspired by Odin.

His goal?
He wants to see humanity survive forever. He does not want to be alone for eternity.
As a chronomancer he has witnessed mankind destroy itself millions of times. Through careful actions he wants to see humanity develop advanced technology and not destroy themself. Mankind must build their paradise, and survive to enjoy it.

He cannot directly intervene since he is a deity. His intervention causes an equal reaction within the Phant. When he tries changing the world directly with his own hands it erupts into chaos from the other deities of the Phant. His actions give them more power.
Like any phantom deity, he can still affect the world, indirectly. The more indirectly he can do it, the higher advantage he has over the other Phantom Deities. 
The two most notable ways 
1. Through his manipulations the [[Magistum Creation]] started
2. Each and every Archmage communes with Eternal
