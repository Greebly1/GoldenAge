A dystopian sci-fi age eerily similar to our world (but cooler and more advanced). Old tyrannical isolationist countries use the global trade system to choke the free world, leading to geopolitical resource struggles to determine who gets to live a life of luxury.
Propaganda floods the internet and elections are bought.

Mankind for its last time goes to war. Not a war for survival, but a war over luxury. In these last moments, mankind burns its brightest, going out with a bang.
