# Claret Method
Very early on in the [[Magistum Creation]], one of its early members, [[Oscar Claret]] a pioneer of biomedical technology applied the scientific method to revival. Through trials they understood the problem, and through iterations they tested improvements and optimizations. In the end his research group was able to devise a method that yielded functionally perfect resurrection with a very high rate of success. 
Being a member of the early Magistum, Oscar quickly sought to protect his intellectual property. He took full ownership of the technique, and patented it.

# What made his method better?
Several things allowed them to streamline the process of revival, making it cheaper and more reliable.
- Can stay dead for much longer and still be brought back, much longer expiration date
- Resurrectionists do not need as much training
- Revival can be performed on someone you know nothing about. Previous methods required a deep understanding of the dead, often requiring a seer possessing [[Phantom Eyes]].
- Faster, meaning more people can be revived
- Does not incur as much fatigue on resurrectionists, meaning more people can be revived
- Had a higher success rate

All in all, this made the Claret Method the no-brainer. It allowed humans to scale resurrection up easily, instead of relying on gifted divine sorcerers.

### What Was his method
TODO
	What does a Claret revival procedure look like?

Claret's method involved a rare metal [[Thanatite]] in order to optimize the process. 
This metal, is in demand, and usually not enough are in supply.
Because of this, [[Cadavariums]] were created; infrastructure and institutions were made to house the dead awaiting revival.
