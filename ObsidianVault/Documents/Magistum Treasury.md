A branch of the Magistum that manages the fundings and resources. Furthermore, they also handle regional currency conversion and non-liquid assets such as land and magnus energy.

The treasury has the task of granting subsidies and grants as outlined in legislation made by the Magistum. It uses a hierarchy to manage local funds and resources. 

# Guilds and Contractors
### Contracts
Instead of the Magistum directly managing a lot of the funds and endeavors, the treasury receives a budget for a given endeavor and writes up contracts for specific companies to carry out the task, such as building international railways. Contracts must go to the 3 houses for approval.
