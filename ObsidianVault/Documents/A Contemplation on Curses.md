Nightjar keeps a memento to this story in her hideout, a children's drawing of her.
# Intro
Nightjar has the ability to see curses, to see negativity. Her life's goal is to destroy all curses. One day while she is viewing the city from high up she is looking at the masses, the sad, the needy. Some people are just full of hate, or sadness, and they spread it around. The racists, the striking workers, the criminals. She wonders why, what causes some adults to be this way. 

She turns her gaze to a schoolhouse letting out children. She observes intently, deeply. A few of the children are cursed, it is a faint almost invisible aura. Nightjar takes notice of one girl in particular.

# 1 Observation
'I always feel like a creep when doing this, but it's fine, I'm just doing my job as a sleep paralysis demon'
Nightjar follows the child home with her mother. When home she slips in through a shadow in the crook of a window. The girl is in her room drawing, and nightjar stands behind her looking at what she is drawing, she has no shadow. But the girl senses something and turns around, nightjar is no longer there.
Nightjar investigates the mother.
"She is crying on the couch, why?"
Nightjar explores the rest of the house, it is messy.
Nightjar stays in the house for the rest of the night, waiting. She witnesses a few things
The child tells her mother she is hungry, and the mother appears to stop being sad for a moment, and scrounges up a meal for her daughter.
The mother holds her daughter. Nightjar sees the two have a loving moment.

After this the girl seems saddened, and can't get to sleep. Noticing this, nightjar steps in to help. By introducing herself to the girl like she is an imaginary friend, or a guardian. NJ uses a spell to put the girl to sleep.

Concluding remarks
"There is a single mother, sad, probably for a missing husband. But she becomes strong when her daughter needs her. But, the daughter is sad for her mother. What will happen to the girl?"
"There is no magic to this... I cannot just take it away like I do other curses. Yet, evidently this is a curse in some sense."
# Mother
NJ begins following the mother.
It appears she works at a brewery. And that her husband left her for a more attractive woman. She is not particularly attractive.
She does not make enough money to continue paying for her daughter's education. 
"So that is what will happen to the daughter"
Nightjar leaves a bunch of extra money on the table.
# Matchmaking
After a few days, NJ decides to intervene.
"If the mother can become happy and prosperous, then the daughter will stop being sad for her mother."

She visits an old friend she helped out a while ago. #TODO, make a name and backstory. He had a fiery curse that covered his face in permanent burns. They have healed quite a bit but he is still disfigured. Thanks to NJ he is still alive, working at a resurrection clinic pushing papers. He is actually a good help to her when she needs information. 

The two have some chitchat, things like
"Haven't seen you in ages, what brings you around"
"I have a project I'm working on, you still owe me for saving you."
"How are you doing, you seem better, but lonely"
"How long have you been cooped up in here pushing papers"
Then they move onto discussing what she wants
"There is a woman I wish for you to court."
"What?"
"A single mother, she works at a bar."
"..."
"I want you to go drink at this bar and talk to her"
"That isn't how this works you know, you see my face right."
"I just want you to go drink at this bar instead of drinking here, alone."

Of course nightjar is hoping the two will get along.

For the next few weeks nothing much seems to change. he drinks at the bar every night and talks to her occasionally. Nightjar keeps tabs on the two. She intervenes here and there, sending anonymous letters to the two like
"A friend of yours has entered you into a mixer party"
"He likes you but isn't confident enough to ask you out. -A friend of his"

Eventually she get the two together.

# Conclusion
The daughter does not seem sad anymore, at least not nearly as sad. The family as a whole seems happy, albeit far from perfect. The ending of the story is a contemplation on the nature of curses, and how they are more than just magic fairytale.
"Some curses, no, most curses are not magic in nature. A curse can be as mundane as a bad memory, or loneliness, or insecurity. Yet they can be broken like any other curse."
"Interestingly they were so sad, but now they seem so happy, even happier than the other functional families it seems."

She speaks to the guy she helped, he says
"Thankyou, I think there is a duality to this. If I were to never have been cursed, or never have been lonely, would I feel the same? I don't know, but I think that by being sad, by having the memory of loneliness, I am more happy to be where I am now."

"The ultimate curse, sadness, folds and bends to happiness and strength. This family is even stronger now."

Nightjar gives the house one last inspection before leaving. The daughter is asleep. 
"You have a bright future ahead of you now, I will be watching over you to see what you make of it."
As she goes to leave, she notices a drawing. It is a child's drawing of her, the Nightjar. 
Nightjar is extremely touched by this drawing, it is not only a memento to this project, but, it is one of the few times she gets to see what she looks like. She has no reflection and no real other way of seeing herself whenever she wants to. Although she knows she is a creepy grotesque monster. She takes the drawing back to her hideout.
