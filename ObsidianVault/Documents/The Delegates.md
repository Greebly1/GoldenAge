Each nation that enters membership with the Magistum is to send one delegate to represent them, usually this is the King, however it is entirely up to that nation to decide who their delegate will be.
The delegation has few powers, only able to propose and vote on legislation.

The importance of this committee is not to be lost though. This can be the most important committee. As they often independently operate as a sort of United Nations.

Any legislation they vote in favor of goes to the Senate.
