Thanatos is the Greek personification of death.

Despite the name, thanatite is a very beautiful metal alloy. It is full of hopes and dreams.

# Where to find it
Thanatite can be found in two places
- Underground in low density
- Inside the kidney of demons

# Mining Thanatite
Mining for thanatite is destructive to the environment. Since it is in such a low density only open-pit quarries that chemically extract minerals can yield a decent amount of thanatite.

# Demon Kidney
While the reason it forms is hotly debated, many believe that since the process of demonification, causes individuals to discard their hopes and dreams, the kidney of a demon filters out both toxins and hope. Stronger demons, who have sacrificed more of themself will have more thanatite. But this is not based in science.


# Use
Thanatite is used in the [[Claret Method]] of revival. As such it is expensive stuff, sometimes even more so than gold.

## Scarcity
Thanatite can only be made from the corpses of demons, and demons can only be made from people. Meaning, there will **never** be enough thanatite to go around for every human. 
In order to resurrect half of the human population, the other half would need to die and be harvested, roughly speaking.

# Synthetic Thanatite
