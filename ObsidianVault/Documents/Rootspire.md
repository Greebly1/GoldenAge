A dark labyrinthian substructure that was allegedly built by the ancient [[Latrican]]s during [[Latrican Ascent]].

Entrances to the Rootspire are scattered across #TODO (name of European continent) in caves.
Some of these entrances are guarded and revered as holy sites. 
	Some entrances are even found in other planes and pocket dimensions
# Expeditions
Numerous expeditions are always underway to attempt to map and understand the Rootspire. Most routes terminate in dead ends or cave system collapses, but occasionally they connect to other Rootspire entrances or substratum ecosystems and pocket dimensions.

These expeditions find rare minerals, forgotten magical artifacts with effects impossible to reverse engineer, ancient texts and paintings, masonic wall tapestries depicting prophecies, and of course, monsters.

# Brainstorm
- A character may get lost in the Rootspire (maybe they wanted to get lost)
- An army or platoon may be forced to retreat into an unknown entrance to the Rootspire, and be pursued by the ones they are trying to escape from.
- An expedition may temporarily halt, or return with excavation equipment while they attempt to clear a cave system collapse
- A cave may collapse trapping a group (potentially separating people), in the Rootspire.
- The criminal underworld, or a malicious bad actor may use the Rootspire for smuggling, or as their HQ
- A massive doorway to the underworld remains locked
